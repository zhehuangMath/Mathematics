measure theory notes
1.1 Sets
About power sets  : When talking about sets of sets. We denote the collection
of subsets, or power set, of a set X by P(X). The notation 2^x is also used.
(that's to say you have the subsets with 0  or 1 or 2 ... n elements . if you sum up n choose 0 , n choose 1 , n choose 2 ,... n choose n , and the result is 2^x.  where n is the number of elements in x. 
another intuition is the fact each element has 2 possible results , either being selected ,or not).
 
About de morgan's law. 
E complement = X \ E. ( the parts belongs to x but not E , where E ⊂ X).
In n elements case: 
The complement of (U Ei). where (i ⊂ N )  If we pick an element a ⊂ x/E1 , and intersects it with b ⊂ x/E2,...(n ⊂ x/En ).
Image you have a whole rectangular as your sample space. Inside you have some complicates sets intersect with each other randomly. Now all areas are white before any action is taken. After an arbitrary element a ⊂ x/E1 is selected . Traversing through index, we find first the area outside set E1 complement and inside X becomes black. Then as E2 complement intersection comes, the area of E2  previously ⊂ X/E1 becomes white. As this process goes, the central area shrinks to white gradually . 

Index set notation :
We say that a collection
C = {Eα ⊂ X : α ∈ I}
of subsets of a set X, indexed by a set I, covers E ⊂ X if
[
α∈I
Eα ⊃ E.
The collection C is disjoint if Eα ∩ Eβ = ∅ for α not equal to β. This is also called pairwise disjoints. 
The Cartesian product, X × Y = {(x, y) : x ∈ X, y ∈ Y } .

1.2. Topological spaces
From above we have the basic concepts of subsets.
definition:
A topological space is an ordered pair (X, τ), where X is a set and τ is a collection of subsets of X, if the following axioms hold:
1. The empty set and X itself belong to τ.   ( ∅, X ∈ T ;) 
2.Any (finite or infinite) union of members of τ still belongs to τ. 
 if {Uα ∈ T : α ∈ I} is an arbitrary collection of open sets, then their
union
[
α∈I
Union Uα ∈ T is open;
3.The intersection of any finite number of members of τ still belongs to τ.
(c) if {Ui ∈ T : i = 1, 2, . . . , N} is a finite collection of open sets, then their
intersection
Intersection Ui ∈ T is open .
The complement of an open set in X is called a closed set, and T is called a topology
on X.
Examples ：
 1 Dimension Euclidean Space ‘s open interval from a T on R
 2. X= {1,2,3,4} from property 1 . {∅ must be contained , and {1,2,3,4} must be contained}
    t= {∅,{1,2,3,4}, {2} {1,2}  {1,2 ,3 } { 2,3} { 3,4} } from instance.
  3. Any metirc space is a Topological space. 
1.3 extend real line . Not that important. 
1.4 measure 
(1) it is an extension of length ,  u{[a,b]}= b-a.
(2)u:p(R)->R+U{+infinite} note that R+ R^+ denotes the real positive numbers. u denotes the measure.
(3) for a set A in R.  A+x={x+y where y in A}.
For all A in R , all X in R, U (A+x)= U(A).
(4)
Suppose X is a set and P(x) is its power set, which denotes the collection of all subsets of X.  A measure u on x is a function mapping from p(x) ->[0, infinite].
s.t u(∅)=0;
